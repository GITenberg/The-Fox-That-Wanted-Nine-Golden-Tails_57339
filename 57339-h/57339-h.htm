CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HE WAS a Japanese fox, and although
he looked just like any other
fox, he knew a few things that his American
brothers have never heard about even
to this day. One of these things was that
if he lived to be one hundred years old
without ever being chased by a dog, he
could become a beautiful woman; if he
lived for five hundred years and never a
dog pursued him, he could be changed into
a mighty wizard who would know more
than any man on earth; but, better than
all, after a thousand years of peace he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
would turn into a celestial fox and have
nine golden tails.</p>

<p>Now a beautiful woman does very well
in her place and it is a great honor to be
a wise man, but a fox with nine golden
tails is the most wonderful thing in all the
world. For that reason when the fox was
very young, only about sixty or seventy-five,
he thought he would refuse to be
changed into either a woman or a wizard
and would wait for his thousandth birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are enough pretty women and
wise men in the world now,&#8221; he explained
to his friends of the forest. &#8220;The pretty
women make the trouble and the wise men
try to straighten it out, and they are both
kept busy. They don&#8217;t have half as much
fun as a fox.&#8221; But as the years went by
he grew so tired of skulking and hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
about, and being nothing but a common,
every-day, bushy-tailed gray fox that he
almost decided to compromise the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, there are worse things in the
world than pretty women,&#8221; he said,
scratching his ear, &#8220;and wise men have
their uses.&#8221;</p>

<p>What settled the question quite suddenly
was a most exciting adventure he
had just when he had begun to think he
was cunning enough to outwit all the dogs
on the Island of Japan. Now, he had had
a great deal of experience in this line, and
it was no wonder he flattered himself his
dodging tactics were perfect. His ear was
so trained he could hear a dog barking
miles away, and he could smell a pack of
hounds even further than he could hear
them. Besides, when he looked at their
tracks he knew exactly how long it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
been since they passed that way, and as
he had many acquaintances among the
birds and bees and butterflies, they, too,
often gave him timely warning.</p>

<p>He had also traveled extensively and
knew all the safe places for a fox to stop.
At last, after enduring many hardships
and sleeping in swamps and on beds of
nettles, and sometimes having to run all
night and not sleep at all, and being
forced to move so many times that he
never had any home feeling, he had discovered
the most delightful spot imaginable.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful wood toward the
north of the island, where the gnarled old
trees were so thick and crooked and the
weeds so tall that the sun never touched
the ground, and it was so dark and gloomy
there men said it was the home of gnomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and goblins and no one could be induced
to pass through it. Even the little streams
gurgled hoarsely and their waters were
black, and the great owls couldn&#8217;t tell
when it was night and so hooted throughout
the day, and bats were always flying
about with shrill screams.</p>

<p>As many wild creatures looking for
peace found their way here and never
again went out of the forest, he had much
good company. There were foxes, bears,
birds, deer, monkeys, rabbits, squirrels,
pigeons, ducks, and a host of tiny things
like worms, beetles, scorpions, mice, ants,
lizards, centipedes, frogs, grasshoppers,
eels, snails, crabs and caterpillars, and also
a wild hen and her mate, who had a very
hard time ever raising a family, a pouyou
brought all the way from South America
with the initials of a sailor who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
never see it again cut on its brown shell
armor, crickets that the Japanese call
grass larks and that sing more sweetly
there than any place in the world, a tortoise
so many hundreds of years old he
didn&#8217;t remember when he was born, a
rusty old crocodile who called himself
Luxuriant-Thick-Mud-Master and a parrot
that had known the misery of living in
a cage until once the door was left open.
Then he went away without saying good-by
and flew straight over the hills and
rivers and rice fields until he lit on a tree
in this wood. How he chuckled when he
knew he had reached the land he had so
often heard about, the land the birds call
Napatantutu, which in their language
means Stay Here Always. And at first
he thought it a great joke to scream &#8220;Look
out,&#8221; and a few other human words not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
so polite, and throw all the animals in a
panic. But after he had been there a
while he either reformed or forgot how
men talked and so bothered them no more.</p>

<p>The tortoise having lived longer than
any of the others, had had time to find out
more, and he said there was a huge monster
in a far-distant part of the wood that
was neither man nor beast, but more dangerous
than either.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Its eyes were bright as any glass,</div>
<div class="verse">Its scales were hard as any brass,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>he declared, and when it roared the whole
earth grew dark with the smoke from its
steaming nostrils, and when it laughed a
flame came out of its mouth that lit up
the sky, and this Terrible Thing was
called a dragon. It goes without saying
they were all very careful to keep away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
from the particular place where the
dragon was said to live, and as none of
them had ever seen it, they were not sure
it was there.</p>

<p>The snail had been heard to stoutly declare
he wouldn&#8217;t run from it anyway,
but as the orang-outang reminded him,
it was very easy to be brave before you saw
it coming, but he had heard of snails that
got in such a hurry they left their houses
behind them. The bear asked the very important
question: &#8220;How many legs has a
dragon?&#8221; And when the tortoise said it
must have at least a million, since a centipede
had a hundred, the bear was comforted,
for as he wisely told the fox, one
need not be afraid of anything if it has
more than four legs.</p>

<p>Now there wasn&#8217;t much difference between
day and night in Napatantutu, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
both were happy times, and they could eat
when they wished and sleep when they
wished, and they didn&#8217;t have to do anything
unless they liked to do it. Sometimes
they would eat and sleep all day,
and at night, when the green eyes of the
owls shone like lanterns and the fireflies
lit up the wood with their little lamps, they
would meet in a wonderful dell all lined
with moss softer than velvet carpet, and
there they would romp and play until
morning.</p>

<p>The frogs would sit in a solemn circle
on toadstools, the worms, because they
wanted to see what was going on, would
crawl up on the grand stand, which was the
pouyou&#8217;s back, the ants would hold wee
pink and blue flowers over them for parasols
because they tried to be fashionable,
the monkey was always the clown, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
quiet tortoise the judge and the fox was
the mischief maker, but too sly to ever be
caught in his tricks.</p>

<p>The frog liked to show how far he could
jump, the deer always wanted to run a
race, the monkey would put up a target
for them to throw at, the bear would dance
on his hind legs, while the crickets and the
grasshoppers were the band, and when the
circus was over the porcupine would invite
them to a quill-ting party.</p>

<p>Or if they grew tired of fun and frolic
the pouyou would tell them stories about
a land far beyond the Sun&#8217;s Nest, where
the birds and butterflies, the parrots and
lizards were redder than red and greener
than green; and again of a wide world of
water with houses that rocked all the time
floating on it, but where these houses came
from or where they went he had been too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sick to find out, although he had been in
one for many sad months.</p>

<p>And when the thunder rumbled and
flashes of lightning shot through the
leaves, and the owls shut their eyes in
terror and the poor little fireflies put out
their lights, they would whisper to each
other that the dragon was around, and
scamper away and hide until morning.</p>

<p>And then when it was daylight they
wouldn&#8217;t be a bit frightened, and each one
would say the other ran first, and he only
ran because some one behind pushed him
and he couldn&#8217;t help it. And they would
pooh! pooh! and declare in a chorus they
didn&#8217;t believe there was any such thing as
a dragon. But the fox, who was usually a
big talker, never had anything to say except
once, when he told them quite seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
he hoped there was a real, true, live
dragon. But no one believed him.</p>

<p>They did not know that when he was a
baby fox, only about the size of a cat, and
lived in the Fertile Plain of Sweet Flags,
one cool and dewy night his mother made
a bed of leaves behind a log, and as she
cuddled him close to her warm bosom she
told him how to know if the dogs were
anywhere around.</p>

<p>She said when the wind brought him a
hot breath out of a cold nose, a breath
that smelt like it had a bark in it, he must
listen with both ears, and after that if he
heard a sound that was neither hungry nor
angry, but came full tilt out of a throat
just bursting with joy, he would know
that the dogs were on his trail, for they
only chased animals for the fun of catching
them, and because a fox was so cunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
it was great sport to run him down.
And if he saw strange tracks, in which had
lodged a caterpillar&#8217;s hair or an ant&#8217;s egg,
the dogs had passed the day before, but if
the tracks were bare, the feet that made
them were not far away.</p>

<p>And she added if he were smart enough
to never, never let the dogs get after him,
when he was a thousand years old a
dragon would give him nine golden tails.
It was true no one had ever seen a fox with
more than one tail, but in the Kojiri, or
Tails of Ancient Things, which was written
on the bark of the oldest trees, it had
always been told that there would be one
fox who would in this way become the hero
of his race, and perhaps he would be that
very one if he learned to be clever and
careful. And as his mother was the wisest
fox on earth, he knew that she knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
she was talking about, and he was glad
now to hear there was a dragon handy.</p>

<p>In fact, Napatantutu was exactly the
kind of a home the fox was looking for,
dragon and all, and he was quite sure he
could pass a thousand quiet years here
without ever hearing the bark of a dog.
He no longer jumped at the sound of
every crackling twig or put his ear to the
ground before he sat down to rest, and
often he would lie for hours on some cool
knoll licking his paws and thinking up
some prank to play on his neighbors. And
he grew fat and saucy and lazy, and
whisked his one insignificant tail proudly
as he walked.</p>

<p>But, alas! there came an end to these
delightful days. Late in the afternoon of
his hundredth birthday, as he stood watching
two ants wage a fierce battle over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
grain of rice, close behind him he heard a
sound that made his very blood run cold.
He raised his head and sniffed the air, then
stood trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dogs!&#8221; he groaned, as a second
time, and nearer now, came the awful
noise, and he darted like an arrow through
the forest.</p>

CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOW Nio Kuro, a Prince and the
most famous hunter in the kingdom,
had come in his boat down the river
that ran through the haunted wood. With
him he had brought many servants and his
pack of trained leopards, with which he
hunted, and which were swifter and had
keener scent than any dogs. Possibly Nio
Kuro had never heard of this forest, or it
may have been that he became so excited
when the leopards started on their wild
chase that he forgot to be afraid of goblins.
At any rate, he dashed headlong into
the wood, encouraging his leopards with
loud shouts, and his servants, after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, followed him.</p>

<p>The fox was crashing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
underbrush just ahead of his pursuers,
now tearing his way through hanging
vines and again leaping over rocks and
streams. The leopards came closer and
closer behind him. On they flew through
swamps and thickets, into thorn bushes
and bramble patches and across deep ravines,
and not even the wind could keep
up with them. At last the poor fox was
tired out. His legs were torn and bleeding,
he had left bunches of his fur on many
a bush and thorn, his feet were bruised
and lame and his breath almost gone.</p>

<p>Too late he found that he had slept
too much and eaten too much during the
long, comfortable days he had spent in his
new home, and that he could not run as
once he did when he was thin and lithe and
his legs were hard and his feet like rubber.
Panting, gasping, his tongue hanging out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
foam dripping from his mouth, he went
blindly on in irregular leaps. The
leopards were gaining on him every moment.</p>

<p>Already he could feel the hot breath of
the spotted leader burn his flanks and he
knew his time had come. Never, no,
never, would he be a fox with nine golden
tails! He would merely die a cruel death
and his one poor bushy tail would be
carried away as a trophy, his body torn
to pieces by savage beasts. As this sad
picture rose up before him he made one
last long leap for liberty, and then his
trembling legs could carry him no further.
Driven to bay, he snarled angrily, and
backing up against the trunk of a great
hollow tree, turned to fight his last battle.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>At that very moment a huge and horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
creature he knew at once must be
the dragon rose between him and the maddened
leopards. Its body was covered
with shining silver scales that crackled like
burning logs as it moved, its ears were
big black wings that flapped like sails, its
great claws had nails as long and sharp as
knives, its double tongue was two red-hot
flames, its glaring eyes seemed balls of fire
and its long tail curled and writhed like a
mighty snake.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a mistake,&#8221; the dragon
breathed, and its words came out in smoke.
&#8220;You were one hundred years old this
morning, and as you have never in all your
life had to run from a dog, you should
have been given the chance to become a
beautiful woman if you wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the chance now,&#8221; panted the
fox. &#8220;There is nothing I want so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as to be a woman, even an ugly one will
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Prince, who could not keep
up with the chase, appeared on the scene,
he found the leopards with their tails
tucked between their legs and their heads
hanging down. There was no fox anywhere,
but the most beautiful girl he had
ever seen stood before him. For a time
Nio Kuro could only look at her, for he
was dumb with astonishment. She blushed
and drew her long black hair over her face
until he could barely see the tip of her
nose and her little red mouth. Then she
knelt before him.</p>

<p>His attendants now came running up,
for he had outstripped them all, and they
too stopped speechless with their mouths
open. The Prince did not heed them. He
bent down over the mysterious maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and so far forgot his manners that he took
both her small hands in his and raised her
to her feet, for he wanted to see her face
again, and the more he looked at her the
lovelier she seemed to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, O fairest one?&#8221; he asked
rapturously. &#8220;Who is your illustrious
father and what is your honored name?&#8221;
But she gazed about her in a puzzled way
and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>The Prince frowned at her strange reply,
for he could scarcely believe his ears,
and he even pinched himself under his
silken tunic to be sure he was not dreaming.
But she was so pretty he could not
be angry with her, and as he looked into
her soft brown eyes his frown changed into
a smile, and he said in a very gentle voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you lost? Are there other hunters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
here who have brought you with them and
now you wait for them to return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all alone,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>He was so surprised he did not know
what to say. At last he stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are only teasing me&mdash;or
it may be that you are afraid of me because
I am a stranger. But no harm shall
come to you through me&mdash;that I promise
you. I am Nio Kuro, a Prince of Hi-no-moto,
the Land Where the Day Begins.
Forgive my rudeness in speaking to you,
but will you not let me guard you and take
you back to your friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no friends and nowhere to go,&#8221;
she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But whence do you come, O sweetest
creature in all the kingdom?&#8221; cried the
bewildered Prince. Again she shook her
head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>&#8220;I belong to the forest,&#8221; she said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henceforth you shall belong to me,&#8221;
the Prince declared, and so he took her
back to his Bamboo Castle as his bride.
There every one wondered at this fair
maid of the forest, but no one could find
out who were her parents or where her
home had been or anything about her, and
the Prince was so charmed with her grace
and beauty he never bothered his head
about these questions that so worried other
people. She loved him and he loved her
and that was all he cared to know about
her, for the Prince was a very clever man.</p>

<p>He bought her the loveliest gowns of
purple and yellow satin, all embroidered
in roses and green leaves and jeweled
butterflies, and she had servants to wait
upon her and fan her and a red and gold
jinricksha to ride in. He called her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
queer Japanese word which means Wild
Flower, for he said she grew and blossomed
in the forest and he transplanted
her and made her a Princess. But that
was just his own pet name for her, and he
ordered that throughout the Land Where
the Day Begins she should be known as
the Princess Hoshi, or the Star Princess.</p>

<p>And he gave a great supper and invited
all the people of his kingdom to it, and in
the center of the table was a cake so big it
looked like a snow-covered mountain, and
around it were blooming all the joyous
and lucky flowers, while out in the court
was a maple tree covered with what every
one thought at first was autumn leaves,
but these leaves turned out to be little
cakes of every color under the sun, and
each guest was given a red paper bag filled
with them to carry home. No wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
they were all glad the Prince had found a
Princess Hoshi, and wished him and his
Star Princess long life and much joy. It
is true there were some who, as soon as
they got away, nodded their heads knowingly
as they munched their cakes, and
said the Princess was an odd person and
perhaps the Prince would one day wish
he had left her in the forest.</p>

<p>Now, a Bamboo Castle is a charming
place to live. There were wind bells hung
all along the eaves and they tinkled with
the whisper of every passing breeze, and
the windows were of paper, so that when
the Princess wanted to look out of doors
all she had to do was to poke a hole in one
of them with her finger and by putting one
eye there she could see everything that was
passing and no one could catch a glimpse
of her, and there were hundreds of mats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on the floor of every room, and these were
soft and cool to walk upon even in Doyo,
or the Period of Greatest Heat, and the
Prince went all the way to the town of
Hirosaki to get her a bronze mirror that
she might see how pretty she was, and
she often looked in it. He also brought
her a long-haired, fluffy little dog, but
she screamed and would have nothing
to do with it, so in its place he
gave her a red cat without any tail that
purred pleasantly whenever she touched
it.</p>

<p>At night she slept on a pillow of shining
black wood, and on it were sprawling,
straggling letters of gold that spelled the
name of the Baku, for the Baku in Japan
has the body of a horse, the face of a lion,
the trunk and tusks of an elephant, the
tail of a cow and the feet of a tiger, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
eats up evil dreams. In fact, it never eats
anything else, and yet it is always fat. So
not only did the Princess have everything
comfortable and agreeable while she was
awake, but even in her sleep only sweet
dreams could come to her.</p>

<p>And on summer evenings when there
wasn&#8217;t any moon the Prince would have
many bright-colored paper lanterns lit
and hung in the garden, and lamps that
looked like flowers would be swung in the
trees, and then he would have his servants,
who had been busy all day catching them
in nets, turn out thousands of fireflies with
their little golden lights all glowing, and
the garden would be changed into fairyland.
The Princess would sit in an arbor
fringed with wistaria blossoms and sip her
tea, while some of her maidens would sing
for her and others with much bowing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
waving of fans would dance in a slow
and solemn fashion.</p>

<p>And again when the moon was a big,
soft, bright ball and the clouds were very
blue, she and the Prince and her maidens
would go to the pavilion in the center of
the garden and climb the many steps to
the top, where there was a room called
the moon-viewing Place of Peace. And
the Prince would tell his flower-wife in the
lovely language of the land that the sun
was a golden crow and the moon a jeweled
hare, and of how Princess Splendor, the
dear daughter of the moon, once ran away,
and when her mother called her she
climbed home on a moonbeam crying
silver tears, and all her tears took wings
and flew down to earth and turned into
fireflies.</p>

<p>But the Princess would have thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
they could not understand and ask questions
that would make even Nio Kuro
smile. Once she said to him quite seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see a dragon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There were
many of these wriggling creatures made
of red and yellow and pink and green
paper, with lanterns for eyes, carried in
the festival procession last year. They
were very amusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paper dragons,&#8221; she cried scornfully.
&#8220;I mean live ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read of them and seen many
pictures of them,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;There
was one called Riu Gu, the Dragon King
of the World Under the Sea, and when
he sneezed the waters would jump up and
tumble over each other in mighty waves,
and every time the dragon caught cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
many a fishing boat went down. But that
was years and years ago, and now all the
dragons are dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she only laughed and said no more,
but she knew better. Perhaps the trouble
was she knew too much to be a Princess,
and that was why she at last got dreadfully
bored.</p>

<p>But for many months everything went
on beautifully at Bamboo Castle and the
Prince and Wild Flower were deliciously
happy. It was very nice to have a magnificent
home, and a lake full of gold fish,
and a shady garden where fountains
trickled drops of music, and little crystal
streams rushed over the rocks and sang to
the lilies on their banks. And it was pleasant
to wear lovely clothes, and eat sharks&#8217;
fins and birds&#8217; nest soup and bamboo
shoots and lotus bulbs and other delicacies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
that only very rich people can have in
Japan. And she was glad to think she
wasn&#8217;t a fox, hiding out in brier patches,
always listening for dogs and sometimes
hungry. Surely it was much better to be
a Princess than a fox.</p>

<p>Then gradually a change came over her,
and although she had everything she
wanted, she was no longer happy. Sometimes
in the day when she lingered by the
lake and watched the little gold fish dart
about like flames in the clear water and
jump up on the bank to get the lard cakes
and rice balls she had brought them, she
sighed, and for no reason at all scolded the
mincing, bias-eyed lady who carried a gorgeous
parasol over her.</p>

<p>And again in the starlit night, when she
walked in the perfumed garden and
listened to the musical drip, drip of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fountain, and heard the frogs calling to
each other from the lotus pools, there came
to her the memory of an enchanted land,
where bats circled and shrieked, and great
owls squatted solemnly on the knotty
branches of the trees, winking and blinking
and never sleeping, and a mighty
dragon with glaring eyes and shining
scales lived in a hollow tree. And strange
to say, when she remembered this dark
and lonely forest her own garden seemed
to her but a stupid place.</p>

<p>After a while she grew tired of living in
a house, even if it was a Bamboo Castle,
and whenever she went out having men
carry her about in a stuffy chair, and she
longed for the shade of the far-away wood,
the sound of the hoarsely gurgling streams,
for a run in the early morning through the
dew-laden grass, for the hum of the bees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the smell of the dead leaves and a nap on
a mossy bank.</p>

<p>So she fretted and grew so discontented
that ugly lines crept in between her brows,
the rose all went out of her cheeks, and she
was so cross the Prince was once heard to
say he had married a nettle in place of a
wild flower. She slapped her servants,
quarreled with her mother-in-law (which
in Japan is an awful thing to do), and was
altogether as disagreeable as a woman
could be. The Prince was patient. He
stood it for a long time without saying a
word and tried in every way to please his
royal lady. One day he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nothing, Fair One, would
make you kind and sweet again? If anything
will make you happy, only say what
it is and I will go even to the ends of the
earth for it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>After thinking a moment the Princess
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me back to the forest where you
found me. If I could only see that dear
place again I would be content ever after.
But leave the cruel leopards behind,&#8221; she
added quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is much game there,&#8221; he said regretfully.
But she frowned and stamped
her little foot angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not kill anything,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;If you do you will break my
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it were best not to hunt
there,&#8221; he acknowledged, thinking of the
evil spirits that were said to roam this forest.
&#8220;It is the Land of Roots and the
Home of Darkness. Why do you want to
go there? Now that you are out of it I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
should think you would want to stay
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she began to cry and got in such a
temper that he was willing she should have
her way, so he had his boat brought out
and made ready. The next morning he
and the Princess, with only the rowers to
keep them company, started on their long
journey. The Princess was silent, and
whenever he spoke to her she answered him
so angrily that he ceased to try to talk
to her. So they sat on the deck, never
saying a word, until the fifth morning,
when they stopped at the very spot he had
moored his boat the day he had found her
and brought her away with him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Princess looked into the
mysterious land, where not a sound
was heard, she gathered up her rich silken
skirt in both hands, and jumping ashore,
ran as fast as her feet would carry her
over the same ground where once the
leopards had chased her when she was a
fox. She lost one of her sandals, her hair,
that was fastened high on her head with
fans and golden pins, slipped down on her
shoulders, and the jeweled clasp at her
waist dropped off, but she never stopped
or looked behind. The Prince followed
as fast as he could, but so fleet of foot was
she that she left him far behind, and when
she reached the big tree with the hollow
trunk she fell down before it, crying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, most powerful dragon, make me a
fox again, for now I know it is better to
be a fox than a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then out of the hollow tree came the
same hideous creature she had seen before,
and when it opened its yawning mouth its
teeth shone like ivory spears, and she
thought it was about to swallow her. But
the dragon only looked at her and sniffed
scornfully until the smoke from its nostrils
darkened the air.</p>

<p>And when the Prince came in search
of Wild Flower only a gray fox
darted through the tangled weeds and
bushes and was lost in the deep, dark
wood. The Prince looked after it longingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi! Oi!&#8221; he cried (which is the Japanese
way of saying &#8220;Hello!&#8221;) &#8220;Would
that I had my leopards with me. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
would I give chase and catch you, my fine
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had no time to bother with a fox
when his loved one was lost in this queer
and dangerous place, and he rushed frantically
about the forest calling, &#8220;Wild
Flower! Wild Flower! Dear Wild
Flower!&#8221; But though he sought her for
many days, and all the rowers joined in
the hunt, he never saw her again. So he
went back to the Bamboo Castle very sad
and lonely, but every one there, tired of
her airs and her temper, said she was a
witch and he was well rid of her. When
he thought over how peevish she had become
he was inclined to agree with them,
and finally he married a pretty and amiable
little Princess and Wild Flower was
forgotten.</p>

<p>And out in the shadowy depths of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
wood a cunning gray fox smiled until
he showed his shining teeth when a saucy
bird, mocking the Prince&#8217;s call, repeated,
&#8220;Wild Flower! Wild Flower! Dear
Wild Flower!&#8221; in its merry song.
Then he lay down and rolled over in
the wet leaves and licked his fur contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m out of that,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll wait until the thousand years
are up. Nothing will satisfy me except to
be a fox with nine golden tails.&#8221;</p>

<p>With never a regret he went back to the
old life, and hunted mice and creeping
things when he got hungry, and when
there was neither moon nor stars, ran
through the black night to the farm house
far beyond the edge of the forest, and
came back in the gray of the morning with
his lips all bloody and his paws as well&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
signs of his midnight feast in the
chicken yard.</p>

<p>The wonderful wood, so dark, so still,
so cool, put on patches of color with the
passing month, and in the few spots where
the sunshine sometimes crept, the trees
grew vivid with the burning glory of
autumn or pale and cold with the first blue
blossoms of spring, then softly pink with
azalea blooms or bright as a glowing sunset
with the flowers of peach and cherry.</p>

<p>And in the Period of Greatest Light
the leaves would cover the ground and
make soft beds where all the wild things
could sleep snug and warm during the
Period of Greatest Cold. As for the fox,
though he was a bit quarrelsome, the years
passed pleasantly and peacefully. No one
ever again came there to hunt, and such
queer things had been whispered abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
about what happened in this pathless
country, where lived such strange creatures
as never man had seen, that travelers
went far out of their way rather than pass
through it.</p>

<p>And on stormy nights, when the wind
howled and windows rattled and the tempest-torn
trees swayed and groaned,
people all over the island barred their
doors tight and fast, for they said: &#8220;The
spirits of the wood are out to-night.&#8221;
And they lit incense sticks to keep them
from coming in, and as they sipped their
tea, told stories about the weird wood. A
favorite one was that a beautiful Princess
was kept there a prisoner by a cruel
dragon, and of how a mighty Prince once
found her and carried her away to his
castle, but she heard the dragon calling,
calling, calling her all the day and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
night, and at last either she slipped out of
the castle and went to him or else he came
and stole her away, no one knew just
which way it was.</p>

<p>And while other brave men would
willingly go to rescue her, yet they all
agreed what was the use, for the dragon
would get her again and they would have
their trouble for nothing. So she had been
there now for hundreds and hundreds of
years, but was still young and lovely&mdash;so
the story ran. But like all legends, it got
a little twisted in the telling.</p>

<p>So many summers and winters came
and went that every one except the fox
forgot to count them. At last a famine
spread over all the land. It was the
Period of Greatest Heat. No rain had
fallen for many a week. The earth was
dry as a dead leaf, the grass turned brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the streams dried up, the birds all died or
went away, one by one the animals perished,
and the once beautiful Napatantutu
was grim and desolate.</p>

<p>The fox was now five hundred years old.
His coat of fur was whiter than when he
was young, his legs were not so nimble and
some of his teeth were gone. He searched
the wood for food and water and could
find neither. He grew so thin that his
ribs stuck through the skin, so weak he
trembled like the aspen when he walked.
The pains of hunger gnawed him day and
night and he felt as if he must surely
die.</p>

<p>Then he mustered up all the strength
he had left and crawled to the big tree with
the hollow trunk. There he fell down, a
heap of skin and bones, and called feebly
for the dragon. When this terrible creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
came out it blew fire and smoke at him
in awful wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you wanted to be a fox with
nine golden tails. Why have you disturbed
me?&#8221; it thundered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fox with nine golden tails is a nice
thing to talk about,&#8221; the poor fox whimpered,
&#8220;but a wise man is better than a
dead fox, even if it had twenty golden
tails, so make me a wizard, Great One, and
then will I trouble you no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; cried the dragon with such fury
that the flames from its mouth flew up to
the top of the hollow tree. When they
died away the fox was nowhere to be seen.
In his place stood a very solemn-looking
old man with green spectacles and a bald
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, this is most peculiar,&#8221; he
mumbled, as he pulled his long gray whiskers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
thoughtfully. &#8220;I will go to the nearest
village and get something to eat, then
I&#8217;ll come back and talk to that dragon a
while. If I can find out some of his
secrets I will make myself the wisest man
that ever lived and then will I become the
richest.&#8221;</p>

<p>From one end of the land to the other,
and even to the islands far off the coast,
spread the fame of the great magician
who lived in a cave on the sea shore.
Princes talked about him in their castles,
and the very poorest people in their little
bamboo-covered huts as they counted their
grains of rice told of the wonderful wisdom
of the Cave Man, as he was called.
&#8220;He can do many strange things, but
there is no use going to him if you have not
money,&#8221; they said sadly. &#8220;He is hungry
for gold.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Meanwhile the Cave Man waxed rich.
The floor of his cavern home was strewn
with shining gold, ornaments of silver and
ivory were on the walls, and he had great
bags of glittering jewels and treasures of
untold value, all given him by those who
had come to him for help.</p>

<p>He could tell when it would rain and
when a man must plant his crop to reap a
full harvest, where money was hidden if
it had been stolen and who had taken it,
who was the right girl for a man to marry
and who was his secret enemy, he knew
what would cure the sick, what would
drive away evil spirits and everything that
any one could ask him. But he was also
very cruel. When the poor sought him in
their sorrow he took away their last cent,
and he gave neither to the sick nor to the
hungry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&#8220;A wise man is greater than Princes or
Kings,&#8221; he boasted. &#8220;Some day I will
rule the land and all men shall pay tribute
to me.&#8221; And he grew richer and richer
every day. But still he was not happy.
No matter how many costly and beautiful
gifts were brought him, he was never satisfied.
He became so mean and miserly that
at last the good King said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must rid ourselves of this man.
Too long have I borne patiently with him
and allowed him to oppress my people.
He is very dangerous. If left alone he
may do great harm and become the curse
of the Kingdom. He has wisdom and
wealth and they have not contented him.
What will he want next? Our heads, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>So one night while the Cave Man slept
the officers of the King crept in, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
beating him with their spears, bound him
hand and foot and carried him off to
prison. All the gold and precious stones
and splendid gifts the people had brought
him were sold and the money given to the
poor, and there was feasting and rejoicing
everywhere, for every one had grown to
hate and fear him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have done much good,&#8221; the
King told him, &#8220;but you worked only evil.
I shall keep you in prison for many years
and see if you will learn to be good and
happy as well as wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wizard went back to his dark little
cell and pulled his long beard all the night
long. When the sun peeped over the big
blue mountains the next morning he had
not closed his eyes. Like many men, wise
and otherwise, he knew better how to manage
other people&#8217;s affairs than his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
He had not been able to bring any charms
away from the cave, he had neither money
nor friends, and in vain he racked his brain
for a way of escape from his gloomy
prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate men,&#8221; he cried fiercely. &#8220;Why
did I ever become one? They are nothing
but stupid, two-legged animals. I see
plainly now that it is more honor to be
even a common gray fox than the wisest
man in the world. Oh, that I had never
seen that miserable dragon!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it did no good to talk this way. He
was chained fast to the wall in a horrible
dungeon, with nothing but bread and
water to live on, and the thing to worry
about now was how to get out. Just as
he was trying to think up some plan there
came the sound of the key turning in the
rusty lock.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next moment he was surprised to
see an ugly old woman coming
toward him. She was dressed in a purple
satin gown with gold birds embroidered
upon it, her bony fingers sparkled with
rings, a long chain of pearls was around
her neck, and he knew by the crown on her
head that it was the Queen-Mother herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that you were very wise,&#8221;
she said, peering at him. &#8220;If that is true,
why don&#8217;t you get out of this dark hole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I could,&#8221; he moaned, shaking his
head sadly, &#8220;but my charms are all in the
cave. I have there a key that will unlock
any door, a mantle that will make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
wearer invisible to mortal eyes, a root that
will cure any disease, a piece of money
that the one who carries it will never have
an empty pocket, and there, too, is the
famous pearl that will make the woman
who wears it seem the most beautiful
woman in the world.&#8221; The old woman
crept closer to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say about a pearl?&#8221; she
whispered breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is a pearl fit for a Queen,&#8221; he
said, pursing up his lips. &#8220;It is big as the
egg of a swan, shaped like a perfect pear
and white as a dragon&#8217;s tooth. The
woman who wears it hung around her neck
all men will adore. She will always be
young, always the loveliest lady that was
ever seen.&#8221; The eyes of the Queen glittered
greedily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is that pearl, wizard?&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
asked, grasping his arm so tightly that her
claw-like fingers dug into his flesh. But
the wizard only smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wise man tells not all he knows,&#8221;
he answered. She caught him by the
shoulders and shook him fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak! Speak!&#8221; she commanded.
&#8220;Tell me where you keep this priceless
pearl or I will have your tongue torn out
by the roots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a pity,&#8221; he said calmly.
&#8220;Then the pearl would never be found,
and no woman would have the glory of
being the most beautiful woman in the
world.&#8221; The old woman screwed up her
wrinkled face and tapped her foot impatiently
on the stone floor. Then she said
with a cunning leer:</p>

<p>&#8220;If that pearl were mine&mdash;so great is
the power of beauty&mdash;I would rule the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
land in place of my step-son the King.
Then would you be my chief counsellor
and next to me in authority, which surely
would be better than spending all your
years in a dark dungeon where no one will
ever hear of your wisdom. You could live
in my palace and have many servants to
wait upon you, and if I were the most
beautiful woman, you could become the
richest man in the kingdom. It would be
a sad thing for the pearl to crumble away
and never be worn by a woman, and also
for the great Cave Man to die a wretched
death&mdash;perhaps of hunger&mdash;in this dirty
hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were only free I could bring you
the pearl,&#8221; the wizard answered. &#8220;No one
save me can ever get it, for it is watched
by a dragon with eyes that are always
open and teeth that are sharp and cruel.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
The Queen looked at the door she had just
unlocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the key,&#8221; she said thoughtfully,
&#8220;but there is not only the jailer without,
but many guards that you must pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have much gold,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;and yet that pearl is worth more to a
woman than all the gold and jewels of the
earth. It will bring her everything her
heart desires.&#8221; She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot buy all the guards,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;Some of them are old and faithful
servants of the King. You must find
some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak of ways as if they were
easy to find,&#8221; he grumbled, and his heart
again felt heavy in his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;They should be&mdash;for a wise man,&#8221; she
tauntingly replied. &#8220;Surely you must
have left your wits in the cave too. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
must be off. The King gives a banquet
to-night in honor of his bride, who is called
the Fairest Creature of the Flowery Kingdom.
And she likes that better than the
name of Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay,&#8221; cried the wizard quickly. &#8220;The
way is found. Know you the weed with
the purple flower that has crimson dots
on its petals&mdash;a weed with glossy, pointed
leaves that grows by every wayside and
sends out a strange perfume after the sun
goes down?&#8221; The Queen nodded. &#8220;Well,
squeeze the juice from the stem of this
weed. A few drops of that in the wine
to-night and all the castle will fall into
sleep so deep that though I rode away on
a prancing steed no one would hear me.
See that my keepers drink of that wine.
Then open my door, unloose my chains
and leave the rest to me.&#8221; The old woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
cackled in her thin, shrill voice. Suddenly
she stopped and looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will return?&#8221; she questioned.
&#8220;You will bring that precious pearl to me?
If you stayed away you would be searched
for in every corner of the land. You could
not escape my vengeance. No matter how
clever you were, the officers of the King
would one day find you&mdash;even as they
found you this time&mdash;and when you were
caught your head would be brought back
to court. Remember my words, Cave
Man, if you play me false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only let me get out, and if I do not
return you are welcome to the head of the
wisest man in the kingdom,&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;But you must give me seven days&mdash;three
to go, three to come back, and one day to
persuade the dragon to give me the pearl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
for he is a jealous monster and ugly when
he is roused. It will not be an easy matter
to get him to give me his treasure, and no
one can steal it from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the sun has set on the seventh
day I will stand before you. Wearing
my magic mantle, I will slip by the soldiers
and the guards like a puff of wind, and no
one will see me pass, no one hear my footsteps.
And because this time I will have
all my charms with me, no man can harm
me. And I will bring you the greatest
gift that was ever given to a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still chuckling to herself, the old woman
unlocked the door of the little cell and
slipped away. When she had gone the
wizard laughed until his chains rattled.
Then he lay down on the hard floor and
fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>That night the banquet in the King&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
palace was a merry affair, and when the
rejoicing was at its height the Queen-Mother
came in and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us send wine to all the servants
and to the jailers and even to the guards
without, that they may all drink to the
health of the lovely Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Good!&#8221; cried the King, as he
raised his cup on high. &#8220;Every one in the
whole city shall have food and drink to-night.
Let it be given freely to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the eyes of many were already so
heavy that they forgot to cheer his words,
and soon one by one they fell over as they
sat eating and rolled upon the floor. At
last even the King was overcome, and
went fast asleep in his great carved chair
with his crown awry. And all of the servants,
having had much wine, lay at their
posts like dead men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>When all was still the Queen-Mother
ran to the prison, and taking the keys
from the waist of the sleeping jailer, unlocked
the wizard&#8217;s cell. He was expecting
her, and he cried impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were long in coming. The people
everywhere will soon be astir, and they will
capture me and bring me again to the
King if they meet me on my way to the
cave.&#8221; (For he did not want her to know
that he was going straight to the haunted
forest.) While he talked she had unfastened
his chains with trembling hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go! Go!&#8221; she entreated. &#8220;There is
not a moment to be lost. Even now the
fireflies are putting out their lights and
waiting for the dawn. See, here is gold
to pay for your journey and food to last
you for a week. Hurry back to me with
the wonderful pearl, and when I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
most beautiful woman in the land you
shall be the greatest man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I return you shall be in truth
the fairest woman men ever looked upon,&#8221;
he promised solemnly. Then he wrapped
his cloak about him and bowed himself
from her presence.</p>

<p>When he was out of sight of the old
lady he laughed to himself, and ran like
a shadow through the sleeping town. On
and on he went, over the Fertile Plain
of Sweet Flags and through the long fields
of waving rice, never once stopping to
get his breath until he stood on the bank
of the river. There he found a boat
fastened to the shore, and soon he was
rowing up the stream with all his
might.</p>

<p>But not yet was he safe. Because so
many people throughout the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
knew the Cave Man and hated him, he was
in constant fear of being seen. In the
daytime he hid in the tall rushes on the
river bank and slept, and all the night he
plied his oars with feverish zeal, until his
hands were blistered and his back about
to break. Once a party of fishermen came
so close to the reedy shore where he lay
trembling that he could hear every word
they said. And what he heard did not
make him any more comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King has offered a great price
for the head of the Cave Man,&#8221; said one,
&#8220;and men are hunting all over the island
for him. Even if he were a needle they
would find him. On the night of the great
banquet he cast a spell on the court and
caused every one to fall asleep. Then he
opened his prison door and ran away.
Now the King will know no peace until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
is dead. And whoever brings his head
to the city will be a rich man for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could be the lucky one,&#8221; said
another. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking in every boat
to-day for him.&#8221; It seemed to the frightened
Cave Man they must hear his heart
beating, so near he was, and perhaps they
would had they not been so busy talking.
When at last they went away he did not
dare to move for a long time, and that
night he rowed harder and faster than
ever.</p>

<p>When the morning of the sixth day
dawned he cried aloud for joy, for in the
dim light he saw the familiar shadows of
Napatantutu. When he had come nearer,
even within the shade of the great trees
and the overhanging vines, he leaped out
of the boat, and as soon as his feet had
touched the ground, started toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
home of the dragon. He had thrown away
his cloak, his food, his gold, for he no
longer had need of them. Once more he
was to be free.</p>

<p>In the wood all was silent and lone.
Not even a bird was stirring as he sped
over the cool, wet grass. The daylight
had not yet crept through the thick leaves,
and once he stumbled over a dead log and
rolled headlong into a muddy hole. The
only light he saw came from a frog who
had filled himself with fireflies, and they
now shone through his round stomach like
a shaded lamp as he slept under a sheltering
bush.</p>

<p>The darkness was just stealing away
when he came to the big hollow tree and
knocked twice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, Most Powerful One, I am here
again,&#8221; he cried, as the dragon writhed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
slowly out. &#8220;It is quite as bad to be a
wise man as a pretty woman&mdash;one is
stupid, the other useless. A fox is a far
finer creature than either of them, so make
me a fox again, O mightiest of living
things, and this time will I be content for
the thousand years to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you never be satisfied?&#8221; snorted
the dragon. &#8220;You are not willing to be
what nature made you and you don&#8217;t like
anything I do for you. Still, as you have
not yet been chased by a dog, I must grant
your wish. But the next time you get into
trouble you needn&#8217;t come to me&mdash;remember
that!&#8221; And a moment later a gray
fox ran past the hollow tree and with
mighty leaps and bounds went crashing
through the thicket.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AGAIN the fox went back to his old
sly ways, and for a time was quite
pleased to be only a fox and live in beautiful
Napantatutu. Of men and men&#8217;s
ways he had quite enough, he was often
heard to say, and he would cock his head
to one side and wink and grin every time
he thought of the poor old lady who was
still waiting for her pearl.</p>

<p>The animals came and went, and their
children and their grandchildren and their
great-grandchildren, and still he lived on.
Most foxes would have been happy to
have such a quiet, comfortable time in an
enchanted land and wouldn&#8217;t have found
anything to worry about. But after a few
hundred years he again got restless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
tired and nothing was good enough for
him. He spent all his time planning what
he would do when he was a fox with
nine golden tails. He talked of nothing
else, and became the greatest bore in the
forest. And he made so much fun of the
peacock, saying it wore painted feathers,
that the poor bird got ashamed to spread
its tail.</p>

<p>Soon he was shunned by all of the animals.
The frog hopped away when it saw
him coming, the grasshopper whirred up
to the top of the tallest tree, the owls rolled
their eyes at him, flapped their wings and
away they went, and even the lazy old tortoise,
that every day came out to take its
nap in a little spot of sunshine, tried to
crawl away in a hurry when it heard him
coming, and sometimes in its haste rolled
all the way down the river bank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Year by year he went from bad to
worse. He found fault with everybody
and everything, and was so cross that after
a while he didn&#8217;t have a single friend. He
not only quarreled with all of his neighbors
and snapped and snarled at every one
who spoke to him, but he greedily swallowed
any little helpless creatures that
crossed his path, so that at last all of the
animals hated him even more than they
feared him.</p>

<p>Then, too, he refused to have anything
to do with any other foxes that found
their way into the peaceful wood, and
made their lives miserable with his airs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are nothing but common beasts,&#8221;
he told them haughtily. &#8220;You will never
have even one golden tail, while I will one
day be the wonder of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better wait until you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
your fine tails before you brag so much?&#8221;
asked one saucy young fellow. &#8220;It may
not be any better than being a woman or
a wizard or even an old gray fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fox with nine golden tails is the
most magnificent thing that was ever seen
or heard about,&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;I will be
the King of Beasts and even men will worship
me,&#8221; and he walked away switching
his one bushy tail angrily. And he could
only console himself by thinking what a
sad thing it was not to be appreciated.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all jealous of me,&#8221; he told
himself, as he didn&#8217;t often get a chance to
talk to any one else. And he fretted and
fumed from morning until night, counting
the years that must pass, and he grew old
and thin worrying because the days were
so long.</p>

<p>But everything comes if you only wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
long enough, and at last the day came
when he was a thousand years old. He
had stayed all night by the hollow tree so
that he would be on hand early in the
morning, and long before it was day he
began to knock and bark and call for the
dragon. Even before the sun had touched
the treetops the dragon came out rubbing
its eyes sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you wake me up?&#8221; cried the
angry creature, blowing out fire and
sparks and smoke until it looked like a
volcano.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my thousandth birthday, and
I want my nine tails of gold,&#8221; whined the
fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a blithering old bother,&#8221;
roared the dragon. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
what you want and you don&#8217;t want anything
after you get it. Well, this is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
last visit to me. Don&#8217;t let me ever see you
again.&#8221; With another snort it raised its
forked tail all covered with silver scales
high above its head, opened its huge mouth
and yawned furiously.</p>

<p>Then it slowly wriggled back into its
dark bed, and standing without was a fox
with nine big, bright, glittering, golden
tails. Never, never had such a thing been
seen by man or beast!</p>

<p>Even the fox was stunned for a moment
when he found what had happened
to him. Then he puffed out with pride
until he almost burst, and held his head
so high that he nearly fell over backward.
He stood alone&mdash;the wonder of the whole
world!</p>

<p>His first thought was to run and show
himself to all the animals of the forest.
And he started to skip joyfully away, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
alas! he was as one rooted to the spot.
Now he found to his horror that his golden
tails were so heavy he could not walk,
much less run. He had never thought
about this, and he stood trembling in his
tracks, wondering just what he would do
about it. Besides, although he knew they
must be very beautiful, he could only twist
his head far enough around to see the tip
end of one of them, and he wanted so to
see them all and know how very grand
he really did look.</p>

<p>He kept lifting up first one foot and
then another, and straining and tugging
in his struggle to trot off and let himself
be seen. But never again would he be able
to run through the cool weeds and leap
over the streams and roll in the soft moss
and kick up his heels in rustling beds of
leaves, for nine tails of gold were an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
load to carry. As he grew more used to
them he found he could manage to totter
along with slow and painful steps, but it
was very hard work. But when he thought
of what the other poor animals would think
and say when they beheld him in all his
glory he again puffed out with pride.</p>

<p>After all, if he couldn&#8217;t get about very
well now, he would have all of them to
wait upon him, so it didn&#8217;t much matter.
All he need do was to stand up and be
admired. It is true he wasn&#8217;t a bit comfortable,
for the tails were like lead, and
already his poor back was aching, but still
one would be willing to have back-ache to
be the most splendid creature on earth.
There never had been, there never again
would be anything like him. He was the
one superb ornament of the world. He
kept repeating this to himself with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
satisfaction. And if he couldn&#8217;t walk, he
could ride in the future on the backs of his
adoring slaves and perhaps that was
better.</p>

<p>As the fox strutted feebly and slowly
through the leaves and over the dewy
grass where he had once scampered and
frolicked, suddenly he saw a procession
of all the creatures of the wood, with the
monkey ahead, coming to meet him, for
they were very curious to know if he would
get his golden tails. He stopped and
stood silent and haughty, waiting for
them. They gathered around him, but
said never a word. And so he cried out
shrilly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold your King! I am the most
wonderful animal in all the world. Never
again on land or on sea will there be bird
or beast or fish or fowl that can compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
with me. Stupid things that you are, fall
down and worship me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, what the animals saw was not anything
beautiful or wonderful, but just the
same old gray fox, with his back bald in
patches, his legs trembling and his body
twisted crooked by the weight of nine stiff
yellow tails that stuck out behind him.
And the more they looked at him the
funnier figure he cut. As he ended his
proud speech he tried to spread his magnificent
tails and strut as he had seen the
peacock do, but he toppled over backward
and kicked and squirmed in his efforts to
get on his feet again.</p>

<p>At this the animals set up a shout that
echoed through the forest. The monkey
laughed until he had to hold on to the limb
of a tree by his tail to keep from falling
off, the bear grinned at first and then let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
out loud ha! ha&#8217;s! the hen cackled, the owls
whoo-ed, the crickets chirped, the pigeons
coo-ed with such glee they gurgled and
choked, the rooster crowed, the parrot
shrieked, the peafowl screamed, the ducks
squawked, the frogs croaked and young
Luxuriant-Thick-Mud-Master bellowed
until the earth shook.</p>

<p>The fox was at first dazed. Then he
thought that he was so marvelous an object
they had all gone crazy at the sight
of him, and he waited for them to come
to their senses. When they had quieted
down a bit he said scornfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Foolish things of the wood, I am not
going to hurt you. If you obey me I shall
treat you kindly. But you must find me
the daintiest food and carry me everywhere
I wish to go. Now hurry and get
me my breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>But the animals saw that a fox with
nine golden tails was but a helpless thing,
not as much to be feared as the spry and
snappy old fellow they had known for so
many years. So some of them laughed
and some of them sat down to watch him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obey me!&#8221; he screamed, his tongue
hanging out with rage. &#8220;There never before
was anything made like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, because you are useless,&#8221; said the
tortoise.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fox with nine golden tails is the
greatest thing in the world,&#8221; he went on,
not noticing the tortoise.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do we know they are not brass
tails?&#8221; asked the owl, and winked
wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is going to keep them polished?&#8221;
asked the practical ant, who was
known as a good housekeeper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>&#8220;Who? Who-oo?&#8221; hooted the owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said the grasshopper promptly,
for he was afraid of work.</p>

<p>The fox, puzzled, helpless and angry,
could only grit his teeth and glare at them.
A spider, remembering how he had killed
her whole family with a blow of his paw,
crept up and stung his leg, the wee soft
rabbits that he knew were such toothsome
dainties hopped around him and laid back
their pretty pink ears and sniffed, the fat
and fuzzy little chickens, who had been
taught to hide under mother&#8217;s wing and
hold their breath when he came in sight,
now flapped their baby wings under his
very nose and then ran away and cried
&#8220;peep! peep!&#8221; at him, and the monkey
giggled and threw a nut that hit one of his
fine tails a sounding whack.</p>

<p>For once the quick wit of the fox deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
him. He could only turn up his
nose and snarl slowly, for he was trying
with all his might to plan what to do next.
He was the richest fox in the world&mdash;the
only living creature with nine golden tails&mdash;but
what good were they to him if these
silly creatures would not wait on him and
worship him? In all the years he had lived
among them he had been greedy and selfish
and cross and ugly, and now he had
not a single friend. But he didn&#8217;t blame
himself, he blamed them. And the rage
shut up within him boiled and bubbled until
he foamed at the mouth. How he hated
every one of them! Oh, if he could only
take off his golden tails long enough to
whip the saucy monkey! And how very
nice one of those downy little chicks would
taste!</p>

<p>&#8220;I have all the gold in the wood,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
said at last. &#8220;I am your King and you
are too stupid to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only men are ruled by a man because
he has gold,&#8221; said the wise old tortoise.
&#8220;We know better. Had you been brave
and kind and good we would now be proud
of you. But you have thought only of
yourself, now help yourself. You have
all that you wanted&mdash;be satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it is daylight I don&#8217;t see very well,&#8221;
said the owl, blinking, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t seem
to me that you are any handsomer with
your nine golden tails than you were with
your old gray brush.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fox started. Could he believe his
ears? Not any handsomer than any common
fox&mdash;he who had nine wonderful,
glittering tails of purest gold?</p>

<p>&#8220;You are jealous of me&mdash;jealous&mdash;jealous,&#8221;
he barked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>But as the animals did nothing but
laugh a great fear came over him. Perhaps
after all his tails were put on wrong!
It had really been quite dark when the
dragon came out, and as he was not used
to giving away golden tails, he might have
made a mistake and stuck them on backward.
Something surely was the matter
with them. He must go to the river at
once and see for himself.</p>

<p>But he who had once been so light of
foot that he hardly left a track in the
softest mud as he skipped along, now
found it very, very hard to get across the
little strip of grass and weeds that lay between
him and the forest mirror. He put
forth every bit of his strength and swayed
and tottered along, and all the animals
followed him, scampering and laughing
and pushing and shoving each other. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
when he at last reached the bank, squirm
and twist as he would, he could not get a
glimpse of himself. He screwed his head
around until his throat hurt, he twisted his
thin body until his ribs stuck out, he stood
on three legs and fell over on his nose
trying to stand on two, but always the
tails seemed to turn around the wrong
way, and the very best he could do
was to see one of them. The animals
kept making fun of him as they watched
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with them?&#8221;
politely asked the bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have to wear them all the
time?&#8221; quacked the goose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, he is going to lend them to
the tortoise sometimes,&#8221; snickered the
monkey. The fox, who had almost tied
himself into a knot in his efforts to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a proper shadow, did not take the trouble
to notice them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One tail is enough for me,&#8221; screamed
the peacock, as he spread his shimmering
fan and danced until he got so pigeon-toed
he had to stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandmother&mdash;who was nine hundred
if she was a day&mdash;told me it wasn&#8217;t
any fun to be better than anybody else,&#8221;
said the parrot, snapping his bill. &#8220;One
got so dreadfully lonely.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the fox only turned his head first
to one side and then to the other in his
struggle to find out how he looked. He
strained and tugged until his tongue hung
out and water dripped from his jaws, he
tried so hard to move his stiff tails that his
muscles cracked, and all the time he kept
backing out, out, until he stood on the very
tip edge of the high bank. But he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
so busy looking for his shadow that he
never thought about anything else, and
suddenly the dirt crumbled under his feet
and without a moment&#8217;s warning he
tumbled backward into the river with such
a mighty splash and splutter that all the
animals got a shower.</p>

<p>When he hit the water he struck out
with all four of his feet, for he was a good
swimmer, but the tails of gold were like
iron weights upon his back, and he only
churned the water into foam as he kicked
and snorted. Then with one great
struggle that sent the ripples flying in
every direction, he shot down like a torpedo
to the very bottom of the deep river.
And he never came up again! The animals
shrieked and ran to the river bank.</p>

<p>The stork, who had been standing on
one leg all the morning, took down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
other in a hurry and hopped over into the
rushes, where he stretched his long neck
as far as ever he could and peeped into the
muddy stream, the monkey wrapped his
tail around a bush to keep from falling as
he screwed up one eye and tried in vain to
see what had become of the fox, Luxuriant-Thick-Mud-Master
toppled off the
bank in his fright and made another
splash, a fish, not knowing what to make
of so much noise, jumped out in the grass
and turned a somersault, the owl snapped
both his glassy eyes, but saw nothing, the
bullfrog dived down as far as he could
and came up coughing and choking, but
the fox, golden tails and all, was gone forever.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He made a plunge where the stream was deep</div>
<div class="indent">And saw too late his blunder,</div>
<div class="verse">For he had hardly time to peep</div>
<div class="indent">Before his foolish head went under,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>sadly said the tortoise, who prided
himself on knowing a lot of real poetry.
But the rabbit winked his long ears
and whispered to the ant: &#8220;Good riddance!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again hundreds and hundreds of
years went by, as they always do if you
wait a while. Every animal that had
known the poor fox had been dead a long
time, and those that came after them told
this tale as I have told it to you, only they
weren&#8217;t quite certain it was true, and some
of the young beasts said it was nothing but
a fairy story.</p>

<p>But one day a pearl fisher came up the
river in his little boat, and while he was
diving down in the deepest part of the
water he found a queer-looking object
sticking up in the mud, and when he had
brought it ashore and washed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
scrubbed it, he found it was a tail of pure
gold. Hardly believing his good fortune,
he took it away with him, and
many wise men looked at it through
spectacles and microscopes, and weighed
it and thumped it and tasted it and
wrote long papers about it filled with
so many big words that no one ever read
them.</p>

<p>And to-day you may see this very same
tail, looking rather old and rusty, in one
of the museums of a foreign city, and beside
it is a card telling that this is undoubtedly
the golden feather that the great
King No-Thing-Fan of Japan once wore
in his crown, which shows that even very
wise people sometimes make mistakes.
But it was the fairy godmother to the poor
pearl diver, who sold it for so much money
that he was able to buy a cozy little bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
cottage for his family and to ever after
give them as much as they wanted to eat,
and so one of the tails of the fox did some
good in the world after all.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
